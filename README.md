# SelfRateable [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ostaptan/self_rateable.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ostaptan/self_rateable)

Clean, powerful, customizable, simple, configurable, gem for displaying and handling ratings, likes, and feedbacks for ActiveRecord model.
People!!! Please provide your feedbacks what functionality to add on the issues page. I'm open to whatever questions for improving this gem.

## Installation

- Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  `gem 'self_rateable'`

- Execute:

  `$ bundle`

- Or install it yourself as:

  `$ gem install self_rateable`

## Usage

Make you ActiveRecord model self rateable:

The default type is :likes

    class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
      self_rateable by: :class_name_of_AR_model_that_can_rate
    end

Rates philosophy as in facebook & vk (like/unlike)

    class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
      self_rateable by: :class_name_of_AR_model_that_can_rate, type: :likes
    end

   	Rate:

    object.like object_of_AR_model_that_can_rate

Stars rates diapasone 1..5 (as on movies)

    class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
      self_rateable by: :class_name_of_AR_model_that_can_rate, type: :stars
    end

   	Rate:

    object.rate object_of_AR_model_that_can_rate, count_of_stars

Rates philosophy as in stackoverflow (+1 vs -1)

    class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
      self_rateable by: :class_name_of_AR_model_that_can_rate, type: :points
    end

    Rate:

    object.vote object_of_AR_model_that_can_rate, bool

This vote method returns false if object-of-AR-model-that-can-rate has already voted once. You can capture that output to show some messages.

 (If true it adds 1 point if false it decreases 1 point)

Run rake task to prepare and update your database:

  `rake self_rateable`
